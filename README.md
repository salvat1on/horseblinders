Horse Blinders RSS Feed Viewer is an RSS feed viewer that uses exclusion keywords to search RSS headlines and remove articles with those words from your news feed

There are already rss feed addresses but you can switch them with ones you want or add/remove some.

the same goes for the exclude keywords. 

if a picture is not found for the article a picture of a horse wearing blinders is used 

keep in mind it takes a moment to load and refresh.

I may add additional features in the near future like a share option
